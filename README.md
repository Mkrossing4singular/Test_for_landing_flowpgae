# Test_for_landing_flowpgae
Html, CSS template for making a web page

testing some templates for webpages where you can add links and serve as a presentation small site for a user.

Eventually adding also JS animations and advanced features freely (work in progress for that).
Still at first stages of the project so It'll seem quite empty here for a while.
